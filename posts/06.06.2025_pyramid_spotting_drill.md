# Pyramid spotting drill

*06.01.2025*

Spotting and centering small drills is not a trivial task. Normal NC spotting drills have a wide web and tend to create a spot with a flat bottom that’s unsuitable to guide small drills.  
There are specialized one or two flute carbide spotting drills for small diameter work, but they tend to be rather expensive and extremely delicate.  
One alternative that I was made aware of is the pyramid spotting drill – This shape is referenced in literature a few times, not only as a spotting drill, but also as a micro engraving tool for hard materials.  
Trying to visualize the problem with the chisel tip/web of standard spotting drills – They leave quite a large flat spot, that might already be too big to guide small drills.

How big is that flat spot left by the web? I am glad you asked.
